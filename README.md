# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Localization

**Abstract: **
Due to the limited sensitivity of the boundary pixels in Glioma brain images, detecting tumor locations is a difficult process. The early discovery of a brain tumor can save millions of lives. We used a dataset of genomic subtypes of lower-grade gliomas with shape features automatically extracted by a deep learning algorithm.  Millions of deaths can be prevented through the early detection of brain tumors. The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to detect brain tumors earlier may help patients live longer. In MRI, the tumor is shown more clearly which helps in the process of further treatment. This work aims to detect tumors at an early phase. In this manuscript, we used Deep Learning algorithms like ResNet50, InceptionV3, and UNet for tumor segmentation. Predicting and localization of brain tumor using image segmentation from the Low-Grade Gliomas MRI dataset. A brain tumor occurs because of anomalous development of cells. Earlier brain tumor detection using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may increase a patient's survival rate. In MRI, the tumor is shown more clearly which helps in the process of further treatment. To save the patientâ€™s time. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most effective method for detecting brain tumor.
